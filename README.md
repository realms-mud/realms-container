# Introduction 
This project wraps the Realms Core Lib project (https://github.com/realms-mud/core-lib) 
and the ldmud driver (https://github.com/ldmud/ldmud) in a Docker container 
**FOR EVALUATION AND TESTING PURPOSES ONLY**. It does **NOT** provide persistent storage
outside the lifetime of a running instance as it is currently set up. 

To use this after you have Docker (https://www.docker.com/) installed, from a command line do the following:

```
# cd <location of this repo>
# docker build -t realms .
```
You can then run it in one of two ways:
```
# docker run -it realms
```
You will see the database start up and the mud load itself
```
# telnet localhost
```
You can also run the container such that it exposes the mud outside of Docker by doing this:
```
# docker run -dt -P --name realms-live realms
```
You can find out which port the mud is exposed on using 
```
# docker ps -f name=realms-live
```
Where you will get output like this:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS                   NAMES
d79c9e7ad5c4   realms    "/bin/sh -c 'serviceâ€¦"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour                0.0.0.0:32768->23/tcp   confident_hawking
```
In this example, you could telnet to your machine, port 32768 and connect to the mud.

Alternatively, you can force realms to run on a specific port like this:
```
# docker run -dt -p 23:23 --name realms-live realms
```

Then, you can just telnet to port 23 / the standard telnet port on your local machine. The caveat with 
this approach is that you must choose a port that does not currently have a service running on it.
